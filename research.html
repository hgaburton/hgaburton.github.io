           We are developing a new way to interpret molecular electronic energy levels
           as stationary points of an energy landscape, rather like a mountain range. The lowest-energy
           level corresponds to the valley bottom, while higher-energy levels are represented
           as high mountain passes and summit peaks. These higher-energy stationary points can 
           provide bespoke representations of electronic excited states.

    Excited electronic states in molecules have traditionally been predicted by considering the response of an approximate
    ground state to an external field, or by solving large matrix eigenvalue problems.
    These approaches are typically biased towards the ground-state properties, limiting the accuracy of
    the corresponding excited-state models. We are exploring an entirely new perspective whereby excited-state
    approximations exist as higher-energy stationary points of a high-dimensional electronic energy surface.
    These higher-energy stationary points correspond to individually optimised &ldquo;state-specific&rdquo; wave functions
    and can provide a more accurate representation of excited-state properties.
    By understanding the structure of this high-dimensional energy surface for different
    electronic structure approximations, we hope to develop new computationally efficient algorithms to locate
    state-specific representations of excited states.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Our energy landscape perspective can also help us understand where and why simple electronic structure
    models break down. For example, the failure of the mean-field Hartree&ndash;Fock approximation in the presence
    of strong electron coupling corresponds to the formation of symmetry-broken local minima on the energy surface.
    Our work has highlighted the prevalence of symmetry breaking in both mean-field and multi-configurational
    wave functions, showing how this phenomenon is driven by the mathematical structure of approximate models and 
    the nature of electronic entanglement in ground and excited states.
    In the future, our aim is to directly compare these idealised model energy surfaces to the exact landscape 
    to understand the failures of current methods and identify new ways to improve our computational models.

           We are reimagining how to model electronic wave functions using future quantum technologies.
           Quantum computers promise to transform computational chemistry by representing an electronic state
           using quantum bits that behave quantum mechanically. However, new mathematical approximations are required
           to maximise our use of this emerging technology. We are tackling this frontier challenge by
           characterising how quantum computers systematically encode electronic states in molecules.

    <p>
    Quantum chemistry is expected to be one of the first areas of research to significantly benefit from quantum computers.
    By modelling an electronic state as a superposition of quantum bits, we can overcome the exponential scaling of high accuracy
    electronic simulations.
    Among the most promising &ldquo;near-term&rdquo; approaches is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which represents the 
    electronic state as a parametrised quantum circuit and identifies the best approximation by minimising the energy.
    However, since quantum computers follow different mathematics to classical computers, we must redesign our mathematical 
    models for electronic states.
    The challenge is figuring out how high-accuracy wave functions can be represented while preserving the physical symmetries
    of electronic states and ensuring that the model can be efficiently implemented using a small number of quantum gates.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Recent research has shown that an exact wave function can be represented using a sequence of quantum gates
    that entangles up to two electrons at a time. 
    However, the accuracy is highly sensitive to the ordering of quantum gates and no consensus has been 
    reached on how to define this ordering <i>a priori</i>.
    We have introduced a discrete global optimisation algorithm (DISCO-VQE) that identifies the best choice
    and ordering of quantum gates, revealing that highly-accurate models can be defined with shallow quantum circuits.
    In the future, our aim is to translate these findings into a systematic hierarchy of theoretical models
    that are fit for purpose in the quantum age of computing.

    <h3 style="padding-top:20px;" id="NOCI">Nonorthogonal Configuration Interaction for Strong Correlation</h3>
    <p><b>
    The energy of molecules near their stable structure is often quite easy to predict by assuming 
    that electron particles move independently of each other.
    However, when a bond is stretched or an electron is unpaired, the positions of different electrons 
    become strongly correlated. This correlated motion can become frozen in multiple solutions to the 
    independent particle model. We are developing new methods to predict such scenarios
    by combining these multiple snapshots of correlated electrons.

    The ground-state of a molecule near its equilibrium structure can usually be predicted with a single mean-field 
    electronic structure approximation such as Hartree&ndash;Fock theory. However, this approximation fails catastrophically
    in the presence of competing electronic configurations, for instance with two unpaired electrons or at
    the transition state for a reaction. We have found that, when many electronic configurations arise, 
    there are generally multiple solutions to the mean-field approximation which represent the dominant configurations. 
    Taking a linear 
    combination of these multiple solutions in a Nonorthogonal Configuration Interaction (NOCI) expansion can recover
    qualitatively accurate potential energy surfaces for all molecular structures, allowing reaction profiles to be 
    predicted.
    </p>

    <p>
    We have recently developed a standardised approach to predicting molecular energy surfaces using NOCI.
    This approach has been implemented in the new LIBNOCI library available with the 
    <a href="https://www.q-chem.com">Q-Chem</a> software package. We have also introduced a second-order 
    perturbative correction &ldquo;NOCI-PT2&rdquo; that provides quantitative accuracy while retaining
    the computational efficiency and chemical intuition offered by NOCI.
    </p>

    <p>
    Until now, the future development of nonorthogonal electronic structure theory has been hindered 
    by the complexity of computing nonorthogonal matrix elements between electronic configurations 
    constructed for different sets of orbitals.
    We have overcome this challenge by deriving a generalised nonorthogonal extension to Wick's theorem, 
    allowing nonorthogonal matrix elements to be computed with the same computational scaling as their
    orthogonal counterparts. 
    Our approach for future extensions of nonorthogonal methods to multiconfigurational wave functions
    and correlated methods.
    This generalised framework has been implemented in the publicly available library 
    <a href="https://github.com/hgaburton/libgnme">LibGNME</a>, providing a community resource for 
    future method development.

       Quantum mechanics is usually considered with mathematically real energies. 
       This leads to the idea that electrons in a molecule
       can only take particular &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; energy levels.
       We explore the fascinating consequences of allowing the energy to be a complex number.
       Under this simple mathematical extension, discrete energy levels become unified as one continuous 
       structure to create an entirely new perspective on quantum chemistry.

    Electronic energy levels in molecules are conventionally considered as real-valued and discrete, giving 
    &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;excited&rdquo; states. However, if we mathematically extend our equations
    to complex numbers &mdash; known as <i>analytic continuation</i> &mdash; we find that ground and excited states become
    unified as one continuous energy surface: a <i>Riemann surface</i>.
    In fact, discrete energy levels only arise by restricting our perspective to real numbers.
    These remarkable continuous energy surfaces allow a ground-state wave function to be continuously evolved
    into an excited-state wave function by following a well-defined pathway in the complex-plane.
    We have discovered the first examples of such pathways within electronic structure theory and we investigating
    how they can be used to locate state-specific representations of excited states.
    </p>

    <p>       
    We are also interested in the fundamental properties of non-Hermitian extensions to electronic structure
    methods and how this affects their behaviour on the real axis.
    For example, the convergence of perturbation theory is controlled by the location of non-Hermitian degeneracies
    in the complex plane. 
    We have shown how the position of these degeneracies varies for weak or strong electron correlation at 
    both zero- and finite-temperature perturbation theory, and how this complex mathematical structure is related 
    to thermodynamic quantum phase transitions.
    Furthermore, we have discovered that combined parity-time symmetry in electronic structure
    can enforce real-valued energies, even for complex non-Hermitian wave functions.
    We believe that understanding these fundamental properties will allow entirely new electronic structure
    approximations to be developed.

        Simple models of molecules assume that electrons move independently in an effective
        field created by all other electrons. The algebraic equations for these models can produce
        multiple solutions that represent different important arrangements of the electrons in a molecule.
        Surprisingly, these solutions can vanish as atoms are moved, creating sudden
        jumps in the electronic energy. We have pioneered an algebraic extension 
        that allows each solution to be smoothly continued over all molecular structures.

    Mean-field approximations such as Hartree&ndash;Theory are the bedrock of modern electronic 
    structure theory. These approximations often produce multiple solutions that represent 
    different electron configurations, or ground and excited states. However, these multiple 
    solutions can spontaneously disappear as the molecular structure changes, creating
    kinks and jumps in the energy surface. 
    We have pioneered Holomorphic Hartree&ndash;Fock theory as a way of analytically 
    continuing Hartree&ndash;Fock solutions beyond the points at which they vanish. This theory
    involves removing the complex-conjugate from the Hartree&ndash;Fock energy 
    to construct a non-Hermitian complex-analytic function. Every holomorphic solution then exists over all
    molecular geometries to give a smooth and continuous energy.
    We have recently extended this approach to Kohn&ndash;Sham Density-Functional Theory,
    allowing the first investigation into how multiple solutions are connected between
    different exchange-correlation functionals.

    <h3 id="20220302CFEL">02-03-2022: &nbsp; Theory Seminar at CFEL-DESY</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    I enjoyed presenting my latest work on the <i>Energy Landscape of State-Specific Electronic Structure</i>
    for the theory seminar at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, based in Hamburg. 
    It was a great opportunity to discuss the connections with their theoretical simulations on 
    the interaction of molecules with intense x-ray radiation and hear about the amazing 
    experimental advances in x-ray imaging.

        <img src="graphics/state-specific.png" width=50%></a></p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    I am excited to share my latest research looking at the mathematical structure of the exact 
    landscape, which is now out in 
    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c01089"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Theory&nbsp;Comput.</i></a>
    On this exact energy landscape, ground and excited electronic states form stationary points constrained to the surface 
    of a hypersphere. 
    We investigate how this exact energy landscape controls the type of excited states that can be found using 
    various wave function approximations.
    These insights establish a proper theoretical foundation for developing new types of computational methods for 
    exploring excited states in electronic systems.

    I was delighted to present my latest work
    on the <i>Energy Landscape of Electronic Structure Theory</i> to the 
    <i>Theoretical Physics Colloquium</i> at the University of Duisburg&ndash;Essen (11-06-2021) and the

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    My latest research on nonorthogonality in quantum chemistry is now out in 
    <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0045442"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Phys.</i></a>.
    I develop an entirely generalised approach to compute nonorthogonal matrix elements for electronic 
    configurations represented with different sets of orbitals. 
    This work unifies two well-established theories &mdash; the generalised Slater&ndash;Condon rules and 
    Wick's theorem &mdash; to create a universal framework for deriving and evaluating matrix elements in quantum chemistry.

    <!-- HF Critical Nuclear Charge -->
    <h3 id="20210315CritCharge">15-03-2021: &nbsp; Critical Nuclear Charge in Hartree&ndash;Fock Theory</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0043105"><img src="graphics/critZ-1.png" width=50%></a></p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    My recent work investigating the ionisation threshold for two-electron atoms using Hartree&ndash;Theory has now
    been published as a Communication in 
    <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0043105"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Phys.</i></a> as part of the 
    <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/topic/special-collections/eisc2021?SeriesKey=jcp"><i>2021 JCP Emerging Investigators Special Collection</i></a>.
    This work uses high-accuracy Hartree&ndash;Fock calculations in the complete-basis-set limit to identify the nuclear
    charge at which one of the electrons in a Helium-like atom becomes unbound.
    I find this critical nuclear charge depends on the type of symmetries that are fixed in the Hartree&ndash;Fock 
    wave function. 
    Specifically, the closed-shell restricted Hartree&ndash;Fock approximation can bind two electrons to a lower nuclear
    charge than the unrestricted approximation, but a fractional-spin error becomes increasingly dominant for 
    small nuclear charges.
    These results emphasise the role of static correlation for weakly-bound negative ions.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    Delighted to share our latest review on understanding the performance of perturbation theory using 
    complex-valued non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, now published in 
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/abe795"><i>J.&nbsp;Phys.:&nbsp;Condens.&nbsp;Matter</i></a>.
    Working with long-time collaborator 
    <a href="https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/">Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois Loos</a> (Universit&eacute; de Toulouse) 
    and his student Antoine Marie, we 
    investigate how the convergence of electronic perturbation theory is determined by the structure of the ground and excited
    electronic energy surfaces in the complex plane. 
    Specifically, discrete energy levels become unified as one continuous <i>Riemman surface</i> and are connected by 
    <i>exceptional points</i> that control whether the perturbation series converges or not.
    Furthermore, we illustrate how these exceptional points can be used to relate the divergence of perturbation
    theory to the exotic phenomena of quantum phase transitions and electronic symmetry breaking.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    Our work on the properties of multiple Hartree-Fock solutions continues. In this paper, now out in 
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00772"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Theory&nbsp;Comput.</i></a>,
    we apply molecular energy landscape
    methods to explore the minima and saddle points on the Hartree&ndash;Fock wave function energy surface.
    We use the simple H<sub>4</sub> model to study the effect of orbital symmetry constraints, basis sets, and 
    molecular structure on the number of HF minima and the index-1 saddles that connect them. 
    The pathways connecting local minima form the orbital analogy of reaction
    transition states, and show fundamental symmetry conservation rules. 
    Finally, we identify the connectivity between symmetry-pure spin states using the generalised HF 
    wave function, providing the most complete picture of the HF solution space. 
    We expect that our results will create new guiding principles for developing algorithms to locate
    multiple HF solutions, encouraging their use in mean-field excited state approximations and 
    multi-reference methods.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    Our project deriving a holomorphic extension to density functional theory (DFT) is now out in 
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00822"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Theory&nbsp;Comput.</i></a>
    Working with Rhiannon Zarotiadis (now at ETH Z&uuml;rich), we investigate the existence of multiple
    solutions in DFT and explore how these are connected to the solutions located using the Hartree&ndash;Fock (HF) potential.
    We find that multiple DFT solutions can coalesce and vanish in exactly the same way as multiple HF solutions.
    By deriving a holomorphic DFT approach, we show how these DFT solutions can be analytically continued
    across all molecular geometries or approximate exchange-correlation functionals.
    This work opens a new frontier in understanding and exploiting multiple DFT solutions to understand
    chemical processes and describe multi-configurational systems while retaining the computational efficiency
    of density functional methods.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    I have joined New College, Oxford as the Astor Junior Research Fellow in Chemistry.
    New College is among the oldest and largest of the colleges that make up the University of Oxford, U.K.
    In this position, I will be affiliated with the Theoretical Chemistry group in the Department of Chemistry, 
    where I will continue my research into the mathematical breakdown of electronic structure approximations.
    I hope to bring you many new scientific developments over the upcoming years!

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;"> 
    Our work on a second-oder perturbative correction to nonorthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is now published in 
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00468"><i>J.&nbsp;Chem.&nbsp;Theory&nbsp;Comput.</i></a>
    In this paper, we derive a rigorous second-order perturbation theory that allows dynamic correlation to be captured
    on top of a statically correlated reference NOCI wave function.
    Our NOCI-PT2 approach provides the nonorthogonal analogue to CASPT2 and yields quantitative energy surfaces for molecular
    systems with strong static and dynamic correlation effects.
    In principle, any set of nonorthogonal Slater determinants can be used to define the reference NOCI wave function, making 
    the approach highly flexible and extendable. 
    We choose to build our NOCI wave functions using multiple Hartree&ndash;Fock solutions and make use of the holomorphic 
    Hartree&ndash;Fock approach to define smooth and continuous energy surfaces across all molecular geometries.

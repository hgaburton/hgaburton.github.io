        <b>My goal is to develop theoretical and computational methods to accurately predict ground- and excited-state 
        electronic properties in molecules with strong electron coupling.
        </b>

        <br><br>
        My work investigates the mathematical properties of electronic structure methods in regimes where they 
        currently break down, allowing us to design new methods to accurately predict the properties of electrons in molecules.
        I am particularly interested in understanding how multiple solutions to electronic structure approximations can
        be can be exploited to describe chemical systems where conventional techniques fail, 
        such as excited-state chemistry or when a chemical bond is broken.
        You can find out more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> and <a href="publications.html">publications</a> 
        throughout this site.

        <br><br>
        I am currently the Astor Junior Research Fellow in Chemistry at New College, Oxford
        and an early-career researcher in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford.
        Please get in touch if you have any questions about my work or ideas about collaborative research, 
        my contact details can be found <a href="https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/hugh-burton">here</a>.

        <br><br>
        <b style="color: #be0f34;">
        In 2022&ndash;23, I will be offering a Part II project in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford.
        For information about possible projects, please take a look at my 
        <a href="research.html">research</a> or contact me via <a href="mailto:hugh.burton@chem.ox.ac.uk">email</a>.
